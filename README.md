<!-- In this chapter, I learned how to write conditional tests, which always evaluate to True or False. I explored various types of conditional statements, including simple if statements, if-else chains, and if-elif-else chains. These structures allowed me to identify particular conditions I needed to test and determine when those conditions were met in my programs.

I also learned to handle certain items in a list differently than others while continuing to utilize the efficiency of a for loop. Additionally, I revisited Pythonâ€™s style recommendations to ensure that my increasingly complex programs remain easy to read and understand. -->
